<FONT COLOR=cyan><B><P><u>Launch services (SSLV, PSLV, GSLV and LVM3 )</u></P></B></FONT>
<FONT color="#b38775"><P>DoSISRO has been providing Launch services for customer satellites since 1999 onboard ISRO�s Polar Satellite Vehicle (PSLV). Till June 2019, 319 customer satellites from 33 countries have been launched onboard PSLV on commercial basis through its commercial arm . In September 2016, PSLV C-37 has successfully injected 104 satellites into orbit � the highest number of satellites launched in a single mission so far. PSLV is a versatile vehicle, capable of launching satellites into LEO (Low Earth Orbit) , SSO, Sub-GTO, GTO (Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit) Orbits. With ISRO operationalising its Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) and LVM3 and building Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), as a launch on demand Vehicle, NSIL is in a position to offer and expand its launch services. The launches will be accomplished from Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), India�s Spaceport, located at Sriharikota, near Chennai. Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) employing cryogenic stage is intended to carry heavier satellites of the order of 2200 kg into the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbits (GTO). The heavy lift launcher LVM3 has enhanced the GTO capability to over 4000 kg. The Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) is intended to carry 500 kg satellite to 500km LEO (Low Earth Orbit) Orbit. With the suite of launch vehicles developed and operationalised by ISRO, NSIL offers comprehensive launch solutions � for both Ride Sharing and Dedicated Missions � with a wide variety of flight proven payload separation systems and adaptors developed in-house for all category of satellites.

<FONT color="#b38775"><P><b>SLP, which became operational in 2005 was conceived and implemented as a facility upgradation to support for the increasing launch demands that ISRO was facing. Built by Mecon Limited, a Govt of India enterprise located at Ranchi, Jharkhand, the SLP follows the Integrate, Transfer and Launch (ITL) concept, wherein, the vehicle after getting assembled on a Mobile Launch Pedestal in the Vehicle Assembly Building(VAB) is moved to the launch pad in a vertical position, on a rail track.The facility can well support Cryogenic and earth storable propellant storage, servicing and transport</p>

<p><font color=cyan><h3><u>DISASTER MANAGEMENTS</u></h3></font></P>

<FONT color="#b38775"><P>Space based inputs offer unique and crucial data during natural disasters viz. flood, cyclone, agricultural drought, landslides, earthquakes and forest fires in near real-time using space and aerial remote sensing based inputs. These services are available free for all users.

National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM) serves as national repository of GIS based database for entire country coupled with set of Decision Support System tools to assist the State / Central Disaster Management Authorities in decision making during emergency situations.

Current activities to support disaster management support are : Near Real Time Flood & Cyclone monitoring & mapping in the country, Flood Hazard/Risk Zonation for Flood prone states, Spatial Flood Early Warning, forest fire alerts, landslide zonation and inventory, agricultural drought studies and Capacity Building and institutionalization is being done to the stake holders.</P></FONT>
